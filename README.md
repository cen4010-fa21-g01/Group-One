# Group-One
# 1. in which you will include introduction of your team, your team project, and each team members
# 2. Perhaps include each members’ photos and a short bio of each indicating what their specialties and hobbies are etc. This “About” page will be part of your final project
# 3. Then make each person clickable with a link to each person’s individual page for more detailed information about that team member
# 4. For creating individual pages, each individual in your team should clone the team’s GitHub repository into his/her individual shell account or onto your local computer, and within the chosen team framework
# 5. Create a page that at a minimum displays your name and some other image (it is a good idea to use your own image which is useful for your ABOUT page and portfolio).  Please make sure that you have the right to use that image. This work has to be completed by each individual student and then be pushed to the team’s GitHub repository.  The file(s) created/added should then be merged into the team’s GitHub repository. 
# One of your teammates will need to modify your team’s home page to point to all the different team member’s pages. This account (your team’s LAMP server account) will be used to deploy your final term project




# Project Title (Milestone 0)

This milestone helps you to be familiar with the development infrastructures that will be used in this course’s term projects. While most of the work is to be done individually, you can work together with your team to complete the task.  In fact, working together is encouraged not only for M0, but also for your teamwork.


In this milestone, you will learn:

* individual usage of tools 
* most importantly, how to use the tools in team setting (e.g. GitHub, code merging and collaborating etc.).
